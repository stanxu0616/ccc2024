# Introduction
---
The Chinese Charting Contest (CCC) is an osu!mania mapping contest for Chinese players only, which aiming to attract more players to join mapping. Whether new or experienced, it can provide a platform that stimulates the innovation of geneticists and showcases their abilities. The purpose of the contest is "communication first, competition second". We hope that all participants, audience, and members of the organizing committee can actively and harmoniously participate in discussions, and try to avoid conflicts with others.
